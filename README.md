so here i firstly used dictionary and list
 #Dictionary
          since roman numbers are formed from certain alphabets so some basic are "I"for 1 ,"V" for 5. 
          I used dictionary to store their value also I stored some unique numbers like 4,9,40 in dictionary
          because their way of formation is different than usual number like 3,7 etc.
 #List:
          I used list in order to store the keys of dictionary so that i can directly access the keys with just list indices.
